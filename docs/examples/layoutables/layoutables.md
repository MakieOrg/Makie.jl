# `Layoutables`

!!! note
    All examples in this section are presented as static CairoMakie vector graphics for clarity of visuals.
    Keep in mind that CairoMakie is not interactive.
    Use GLMakie for interactive widgets, as WGLMakie currently doesn't have picking implemented.

`Layoutables` are objects which can be added to a `Figure` or `Scene` and have their location and size controlled by a `GridLayout`. In of itself, a `Layoutable` is an abstract type.
A `Figure` has its own internal `GridLayout` and therefore offers simplified syntax for adding layoutables to it.
If you want to work with a bare `Scene`, you can attach a `GridLayout` to its pixel area.
The `layoutscene` function is supplied for this purpose.

!!! note
    A layout only controls an object's position or bounding box.
    A `Layoutable` can be controlled by the GridLayout of a Figure but not be added as a visual to the Figure.
    A `Layoutable` can also be added to a Scene without being inside any GridLayout, if you specify the bounding box yourself.

## Adding to a `Figure`

Here's one way to add a `Layoutable`, in this case an `Axis`, to a Figure.

\begin{examplefigure}{}
```julia
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!() # hide
Makie.inline!(true) # hide

f = Figure()
ax = Axis(f[1, 1])
f
```
\end{examplefigure}
## Adding to a `Scene`

And here's how you can add the same Layoutable to a Scene, which is the primitive object underlying a Figure.
As discussed above, `layoutscene` is an older convenience method to create a Scene with an attached GridLayout that tracks its size.
This is mostly not needed anymore since Figures were added.

\begin{examplefigure}{}
```julia
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!() # hide
Makie.inline!(true) # hide

scene, layout = layoutscene()
ax = layout[1, 1] = Axis(scene)
scene
```
\end{examplefigure}
## Specifying a boundingbox directly

Sometimes you just want to place a `Layoutable` in a specific location, without it being controlled by a dynamic layout.
You can do this by setting the `bbox` parameter, which is usually controlled by the layout, manually.
The boundingbox should be a 2D `Rect`, and can also be an Observable if you plan to change it dynamically.
The function `BBox` creates an `FRect2D`, but instead of passing origin and widths, you pass left, right, bottom and top boundaries directly.

Here's an example where two axes are placed manually:

\begin{examplefigure}{}
```julia
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!() # hide
Makie.inline!(true) # hide

f = Figure()
Axis(f, bbox = BBox(100, 300, 100, 500), title = "Axis 1")
Axis(f, bbox = BBox(400, 700, 200, 400), title = "Axis 2")
f
```
\end{examplefigure}
## Deleting layoutables

To remove layoutables from their layout and the figure or scene, use `delete!(layoutable)`.
