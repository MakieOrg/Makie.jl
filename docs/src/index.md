# Welcome to Makie!

Makie is a data visualization ecosystem for the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language, with high performance and extensibility.

It is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Makie turns your data into beautiful images or animations, such as this one:

```@example
using GLMakie
GLMakie.activate!() # hide

Base.@kwdef mutable struct Lorenz
    dt::Float64 = 0.01
    σ::Float64 = 10
    ρ::Float64 = 28
    β::Float64 = 8/3
    x::Float64 = 1
    y::Float64 = 1
    z::Float64 = 1
end

function step!(l::Lorenz)
    dx = l.σ * (l.y - l.x)
    dy = l.x * (l.ρ - l.z) - l.y
    dz = l.x * l.y - l.β * l.z
    l.x += l.dt * dx
    l.y += l.dt * dy
    l.z += l.dt * dz
    Point3f(l.x, l.y, l.z)
end

attractor = Lorenz()

points = Observable(Point3f[])
colors = Observable(Int[])

set_theme!(theme_black())

fig, ax, l = lines(points, color = colors,
    colormap = :inferno, transparency = true, 
    axis = (; type = Axis3, protrusions = (0, 0, 0, 0), 
              viewmode = :fit, limits = (-30, 30, -30, 30, 0, 50)))

record(fig, "lorenz.mp4", 1:120) do frame
    for i in 1:50
        push!(points[], step!(attractor))
        push!(colors[], frame)
    end
    ax.azimuth[] = 1.7pi + 0.3 * sin(2pi * frame / 120)
    notify(points)
    notify(colors)
    l.colorrange = (0, frame)
end
set_theme!() # hide

## Installation

First, choose one (or more) of the four backend packages (more info under [What is a backend](@ref)):

- [GLMakie](@ref) (OpenGL based, interactive)
- [CairoMakie](@ref) (Cairo based, static vector graphics)
- [WGLMakie](@ref) (WebGL based, runs in the browser)
- [RPRMakie](@ref) (Experimental ray-tracing using RadeonProRender)

Then install it using Julia's package manager `Pkg`:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("GLMakie")
```

There's no need to install `Makie.jl` separately, it is re-exported by each backend package.

## First Steps

If you are new to Makie, have a look at [Getting started](@ref).

For inspiration, visit [Beautiful Makie](https://beautiful.makie.org/) for a collection of interesting plots.

An overview of third-party packages that expand Makie's capabilities is at [Ecosystem](@ref).
