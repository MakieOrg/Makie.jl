# Dimension conversions

Starting with Makie v0.21, support for types like units, categorical values and dates has been added.
They are converted to a plottable representation by dim(ension) converts, which also take care of axis ticks.
In the following sections we will explain their usage and how to extend the interface with your own types.

## Examples

The basic usage is as easy as replacing numbers with any supported type, e.g. `Dates.Second`:

```@figure dimconverts
using CairoMakie, Makie.Dates, Makie.Unitful
CairoMakie.activate!() # hide
Makie.inline!(true) # hide

f, ax, pl = scatter(rand(Second(1):Second(60):Second(20*60), 10))
```

Once an axis dimension is set to a certain unit, one must plot into that axis with compatible units.
So e.g. hours work, since they're compatible with the unitful conversion:

```@figure dimconverts
scatter!(ax, rand(Hour(1):Hour(1):Hour(20), 10))
# Unitful works as well
scatter!(ax, LinRange(0u"yr", 0.1u"yr", 5))
f
```

Note that the units displayed in ticks will adjust to the given range of values.

Going back to just numbers errors since the axis is unitful now:

```julia
try
    scatter!(ax, 1:4)
catch e
    return e
end
```

Similarly, trying to plot units into a unitless axis dimension errors too, since otherwise it would alter the meaning of the previous plotted values:

```julia
try
    scatter!(ax, LinRange(0u"yr", 0.1u"yr", 10), rand(Hour(1):Hour(1):Hour(20), 10))
catch e
    return e
end
```

you can access the conversion via `ax.dim1_conversion` and `ax.dim2_conversion`:

```julia
(ax.dim1_conversion[], ax.dim2_conversion[])
```

And set them accordingly:

```julia
f = Figure()
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; dim1_conversion=Makie.CategoricalConversion())
```

### Experimental DynamicQuantities.jl support

!!! warning
    This feature might change outside breaking releases, since the API is not yet finalized

Makie also provides support for [DynamicQuantities.jl](https://github.com/SymbolicML/DynamicQuantities.jl). This can used almost as a drop-in replacement for Unitful.jl, with the following key design differences:

* There is no conversion support between Dates.jl and DynamicQuantities.jl objects. Use `1.0u"hr"` in place of `Dates.Hour(1.0)`, `1.0u"d"` in place of `Dates.day(1.0)`, etc.
* Units are set by the first object plotted by default. This is to prevent unexpected changes to other units when plotting multiple objects on the same axis.
* Units are displayed in SI be default. Use `us"<desired unit>"` (note the `s`) to explicitly set your desired units, either implicitly in a plot call or explicitly as a `dim_conversion` axis argument.

Below are four common usage examples to construct the same plot. Please file a bug report if you find an issue with this experimental feature!

```@setup DQ_dimconverts
# TODO: not sure why this needs to be defined in a setup block first
using DynamicQuantities
```

```@figure DQ_dimconverts
using DynamicQuantities

# Implicitly define figure, axis, and units
f, ax, pl = scatter((100:100:1_000)us"cm")
scatter!(ax, (10:-1:1)u"m")

# Implicitly define axis and units
scatter(f[1, 2], (100:100:1_000)us"cm")
scatter!(f[1, 2], (10:-1:1)u"m")

# Explicitly define axis, implicitly define units
ax3 = Axis(f[2, 1])
scatter!(ax3, (100:100:1_000)us"cm") # The first plot sets the units
scatter!(ax3, (10:-1:1)u"m")

# Explicitly define axis and units
ax4 = Axis(f[2, 2]; dim2_conversion=Makie.DQConversion(us"cm"))
scatter!(ax4, (100:100:1_000)u"cm") # No need for us"cm" now
scatter!(ax4, (10:-1:1)u"m")

f
```

### Limitations


-   For now, dim conversions only works for vectors with supported types for the x and y arguments for the standard 2D Axis. It's setup to generalize to other Axis types, but the full integration hasn't been done yet.
-   Keywords like `direction=:y` in e.g. Barplot will not propagate to the Axis correctly, since the first argument is currently always x and second always y. We're still trying to figure out how to solve this properly
-   Categorical values need to be wrapped in `Categorical`, since it's hard to find a good type that isn't ambiguous when defaulting to a categorical conversion. You can find a work around in the docs.
-   Date Time ticks simply use `PlotUtils.optimize_datetime_ticks` which is also used by Plots.jl. It doesn't generate optimally readable ticks yet and can generate overlaps and goes out of axis bounds quickly. This will need more polish to create readable ticks as default.
-   To properly apply dim conversions only when applicable, one needs to use the new undocumented `@recipe` macro and define a conversion target type. This means user recipes only work if they pass through the arguments to any basic plotting type without conversion.

### Current conversions in Makie

```@docs
Makie.CategoricalConversion
Makie.UnitfulConversion
Makie.DQConversion
Makie.DateTimeConversion
```

## Developer docs

You can overload the API to define your own dim converts by overloading the following functions:

```@figure dimconverts
struct MyDimConversion <: Makie.AbstractDimConversion end

# The type you target with the dim conversion
struct MyUnit
    value::Float64
end

# This is currently needed because `expand_dimensions` can only be narrowly defined for `Vector{<:Real}` in Makie.
# So, if you want to make `plot(some_y_values)` work for your own types, you need to define this method:
Makie.expand_dimensions(::PointBased, y::AbstractVector{<:MyUnit}) = (keys(y.values), y)

function Makie.needs_tick_update_observable(conversion::MyDimConversion)
    # return an observable that indicates when ticks need to update e.g. in case the unit changes or new categories get added.
    # For a simple unit conversion this is not needed, so we return nothing.
    return nothing
end

# Indicate that this type should be converted using MyDimConversion
# The Type gets extracted via `Makie.get_element_type(plot_argument_for_dim_n)`
# so e.g. `plot(1:10, ["a", "b", "c"])` would call `Makie.get_element_type(["a", "b", "c"])` and return `String` for axis dim 2.
Makie.create_dim_conversion(::Type{MyUnit}) = MyDimConversion()

# This function needs to be overloaded too, even though it's redundant to the above in a sense.
# We did not want to use `hasmethod(Makie.should_dim_convert, (MyDimTypes,))` because it can be slow and error prown.
Makie.should_dim_convert(::Type{MyUnit}) = true

# The non observable version of the actual conversion function
# This is needed to convert axis limits, and should be a pure version of the below `convert_dim_observable`
function Makie.convert_dim_value(::MyDimConversion, values)
    return [v.value for v in values]
end

function Makie.convert_dim_value(conversion::MyDimConversion, attr, values, prev_values)
    # Do the actual conversion here
    # The `attr` can be used to identify the conversion, e.g. if you want to cache results.
    # Take a look at categorical-integration.jl for an example of how to use it.
    return Makie.convert_dim_value(conversion, values)
end

function Makie.get_ticks(::MyDimConversion, user_set_ticks, user_dim_scale, user_formatter, limits_min, limits_max)
    # Don't do anything special to ticks for this example, just append `myunit` to the labels and leave the rest to Makie's usual tick finding methods.
    ticknumbers, ticklabels = Makie.get_ticks(user_set_ticks, user_dim_scale, user_formatter, limits_min,
                                        limits_max)
    return ticknumbers, ticklabels .* "myunit"
end

barplot([MyUnit(1), MyUnit(2), MyUnit(3)], 1:3)
```

For more complex examples, you should look at the implementation in:
`Makie/src/dim-converts`.

The conversions get applied in the function `Makie.conversion_pipeline` in `Makie/src/interfaces.jl`.
