### Airports

```@figure backend=GLMakie
using DelimitedFiles

fig, ax, ds = datashader(airports,
    colormap=[:white, :black],
    # for documentation output we shouldn't calculate the image async,
    # since it won't wait for the render to finish and inline a blank image
    async = false,
    figure = (; figure_padding=0, size=(360*2, 160*2))

### Bigger examples

Timings in the comments are from running this on a 32gb Ryzen 5800H laptop.
Both examples aren't fully optimized yet, and just use raw, unsorted, memory mapped Point2f arrays.
In the future, we'll want to add acceleration structures to optimize access to sub-regions.

#### 14 million point NYC taxi dataset

```julia
using GLMakie, Downloads, Parquet2
bucket = "https://ursa-labs-taxi-data.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com"
year = 2009
month = "01"
filename = join([year, month, "data.parquet"], "/")
out = joinpath("$year-$month-data.parquet")
url = bucket * "/" * filename
Downloads.download(url, out)
# Loading ~1.5s
@time begin
    ds = Parquet2.Dataset(out)
    dlat = Parquet2.load(ds, "dropoff_latitude")
    dlon = Parquet2.load(ds, "dropoff_longitude")
    # One could use struct array here, but dlon/dlat are
    # a custom array type from Parquet2 supporting missing and some other things, which slows the whole thing down.
    # points = StructArray{Point2f}((dlon, dlat))
    points = Point2f.(dlon, dlat)
    groups = Parquet2.load(ds, "vendor_id")
end

# ~0.06s
@time begin
    f, ax, dsplot = datashader(points;
        colormap=:fire,
        axis=(; type=Axis, autolimitaspect = 1),

    )
    # make image fill the whole screen
    hidedecorations!(ax)
    hidespines!(ax)
    display(f)

#### 2.7 billion OSM GPS points

Download the data from [OSM GPS points](https://planet.osm.org/gps/simple-gps-points-120604.csv.xz)
and use the [updated script](https://gist.github.com/SimonDanisch/69788fce47c13020d9ae9dbe08546f89#file-datashader-2-7-billion-points-jl) from [drawing-2-7-billion-points-in-10s](https://medium.com/hackernoon/drawing-2-7-billion-points-in-10s-ecc8c85ca8fa) to convert the CSV to a binary blob that we can memory map.

```julia
using GLMakie, Mmap
path = "gpspoints.bin"

points = Mmap.mmap(open(path, "r"), Vector{Point2f});
# ~ 26s
@time begin
    f, ax, pl = datashader(
        points;
        # For a big dataset its interesting to see how long each aggregation takes
        show_timings = true,
        # Use a local operation which is faster to calculate and looks good!
        local_post=x-> log10(x + 1),
        #=
            in the code we used to save the binary, we had the points in the wrong order.
            A good chance to demonstrate the `point_transform` argument,
            Which gets applied to every point before aggregating it
        =#
        point_transform=reverse,
        axis=(; type=Axis, autolimitaspect = 1),
        figure=(;figure_padding=0, size=(1200, 600))
    )
    hidedecorations!(ax)
    hidespines!(ax)
    display(f)
end
```

### Categorical Data

There are two ways to plot categorical data right now:
```julia
datashader(one_category_per_point, points)
datashader(Dict(:category_a => all_points_a, :category_b => all_points_b))
```

The type of the category doesn't matter, but will get converted to strings internally, to be displayed nicely in the legend.
Categories are currently aggregated in one Canvas per category, and then overlayed with alpha blending.

```@figure backend=GLMakie
normaldist = randn(Point2f, 1_000_000)
ds1 = normaldist .+ (Point2f(-1, 0),)
ds2 = normaldist .+ (Point2f(1, 0),)
fig, ax, pl = datashader(Dict("a" => ds1, "b" => ds2); async = false)
hidedecorations!(ax)
fig
```

We can also re-use the previous NYC example for a categorical plot:
```julia
@time begin
    f = Figure(figure_padding=0, size=(1200, 600))
    ax = Axis(
        f[1, 1],
        autolimitaspect=1,
        limits=(-74.022, -73.827, 40.696, 40.793),
        backgroundcolor=:black
    )
    datashader!(ax, groups, points)
    hidedecorations!(ax)
    hidespines!(ax)
    # Create a styled legend
    axislegend("Vendor ID"; titlecolor=:white, framecolor=:grey, polystrokewidth=2, polystrokecolor=(:white, 0.5), rowgap=10, backgroundcolor=:black, labelcolor=:white)
    display(f)
end
```

### Advanced API

The `datashader` recipe makes it very simple to get started, and is also efficiently implemented so that most changes like `f, ax, pl = datashader(...); pl.colorrange=new_range; pl.operation=log10` won't redo the aggregation.
But if you still need more manual control, one can also use the underlying `Canvas` API directly for more manual control:
