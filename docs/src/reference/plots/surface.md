## Examples

### Gridded surfaces

By default surface data is placed on a grid matching the size of the input data.
The grid can be specified explicitly by passing a Range or Vector of values as the X and Y arguments.
The positions/vertices of the surface are then effectively derived as `Point.(X, Y', Z)`.
Intervals (e.g `0..1`) can be used to specify the start and endpoint only, implying a linear range in between.

```@figure backend=GLMakie
xs = LinRange(0, 10, 100)
ys = LinRange(0, 15, 100)
zs = [cos(x) * sin(y) for x in xs, y in ys]

surface(xs, ys, zs, axis=(type=Axis3,))
```

```@figure backend=GLMakie
using DelimitedFiles

volcano = readdlm(Makie.assetpath("volcano.csv"), ',', Float64)

surface(volcano,
    colormap = :darkterrain,
    colorrange = (80, 190),
    axis=(type=Axis3, azimuth = pi/4))
```

### Quad Mesh surface

X and Y values can also be given as a Matrix.
In this case the surface positions follow as `Point.(X, Y, Z)` so the surface is no longer restricted to an XY grid.

```@figure backend=GLMakie
rs = 1:10
thetas = 0:10:360

xs = rs .* cosd.(thetas')
ys = rs .* sind.(thetas')
zs = sin.(rs) .* cosd.(thetas')

surface(xs, ys, zs)
```

    S = sparse(0.0I, n*m, n*m)
    linear = LinearIndices((1:m, 1:n))
    for i in 1:m
        for j in 1:n
            for (i2, j2) in ((i + 1, j), (i, j + 1))
                if i2 <= m && j2 <= n
                    S[linear[i, j], linear[i2, j2]] -= 1
                    S[linear[i2, j2], linear[i, j]] -= 1
                    S[linear[i, j], linear[i, j]] += 1
                    S[linear[i2, j2], linear[i2, j2]] += 1
                end
            end
        end
    end
    return S
end

# d is used to denote the size of the data
d = 150

 # Sample centered Gaussian noise with the right correlation by the method
 # based on the Cholesky decomposition of the precision matrix
data = 0.1randn(d,d) + reshape(
        cholesky(gridlaplacian(d,d) + 0.003I) \ randn(d*d),
        d, d
)

surface(data; shading = NoShading, colormap = :deep)
surface(data; shading = NoShading, colormap = :deep)
```

### NaN Handling

If a vertex of the surface is NaN, meaning that either X, Y or Z contribute NaN to it, all connected faces can not be drawn.
Thus the surface will have a hole around a NaN vertex.
If just a color is NaN it will be drawn with `nan_color`.

```@figure backend=GLMakie
xs = ys = vcat(1:9, NaN, 11:30)
zs = [2 * sin(x+y) for x in range(-3, 3, length=30), y in range(-3, 3, length=30)]
zs_nan = copy(zs)
zs_nan[25, 25] = NaN

f = Figure(size = (600, 300))
surface(f[1, 1], xs, ys, zs_nan, axis = (show_axis = false,))
surface(f[1, 2], 1:30, 1:30, zs, color = zs_nan, nan_color = :red, axis = (show_axis = false,))
f
```

### 2D Surface

A surface plot can act as an off-grid version of heatmap or image in 2D.
For this it is recommended to pass data through `color` instead of the Z argument to avoid the plot interfering with others based on its Z values.

```@figure backend=GLMakie
rs = 1:10
thetas = 0:10:360

xs = rs .* cosd.(thetas')
ys = rs .* sind.(thetas')
zs = sin.(rs) .* cosd.(thetas')

surface(xs, ys, zeros(size(zs)), color = zs, shading = NoShading)
```
