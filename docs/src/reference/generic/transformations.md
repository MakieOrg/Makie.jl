# [Transformations](@id transformations_reference_docs)

Every plot contains a `Transformation` object which holds a `transform_func` and generates a `model` matrix.

## Model Transformations

The `model` matrix is composed of a translation, scaling and rotation, with the rotation acting first and the translation acting last.
The translation is set by `translate!()`, the scaling by `scale!()` and the rotation by `rotate!()`.
Furthermore you can change the origin used for scaling and rotating with `origin!()`.

```@figure backend=GLMakie
box = Rect2f(0.9, -0.1, 0.2, 0.2)

f = Figure(size = (500, 450))
a = Axis(f[1, 1], aspect = DataAspect())
xlims!(a, 0.2, 1.2); a.xticks = 0.1:0.2:1.1
ylims!(a, -0.2, 0.8); a.yticks = -0.1:0.2:0.7

# Initial plot for reference
scatterlines!(a, box, color = 1:4, markersize = 20, linewidth = 5)

# Transformed plot
p2 = scatterlines!(a, box, color = 1:4, markersize = 20, linewidth = 5)
origin!(p2, 1,0,0) # apply rotation & scaling relative to the center of the box
scale!(p2, 2, 2)             # double x, y
Makie.rotate!(p2, pi/2)      # 90Â° rotation
translate!(p2, -0.5, 0.5)    # translate 0.5 left, 0.5 up

f
```

By default, calling these functions will overwrite the value set by a previous invocation.
So if you call `translate!(plot, 1,0,0); translate!(plot, 0,1,0)` the translation will be `(0,1,0)`.
To accumulate transformation you need to add `Accum` as the first argument, e.g. `translate!(Accum, plot, 0,1,0)`.

## Transformation Function

The `transform_func` is a function that gets applied to the input data of a plot after `convert_arguments()` (type normalization) and dim_converts (handling of units and categorical value).
It is typically managed by an Axis.
For example, if you set `ax.xscale = log`, the underlying `ax.scene` will have it's transformation function set to `(log, identity)` which will propagate to the plots inside the axis/scene.

```julia
using Makie
f, a, p = scatter(1:10);
Makie.transform_func(a.scene) # (identity, identity)
Makie.transform_func(p) # (identity, identity)
a.xscale = log
Makie.transform_func(a.scene) # (log, identity)
Makie.transform_func(p) # (log, identity)
```

The transform function of a plot can be disconnected from its parent by passing a `Transformation()` directly.
For information on how to add more transform functions, see [Transform Function Interface](@ref).

## `transformation` Attribute

The transformation attribute controls how the `Transformation` object is initialized.
It is processed once during plot construction and then removed.

By default the attribute is set to `Makie.automatic`.
In this case the transformation is inherited from the parent plot or scene if both use the same coordinate `space`.
So if a parent scene uses a 3D camera and the plot uses `space = :pixel`, the transformation will not be inherited.
If the camera is a pixel camera instead, it will be.
When a transformation is inherited, the parent `transform_func` is reused and the parent `model` matrix acts as a secondary matrix transform.
In Pseudocode we have:

```julia
transformation.model = parent.model * local_model
transformation.transform_func = parent.transform_func
```

Inheritance can be explicitly controlled with a couple of Symbols.
For all of these the coordinate spaces of the parent and child are ignored.
- `:inherit`: Inherit both `model` and `transform_func`
- `:inherit_model`: Only inherit `model`
- `:inherit_transform_func`: Only inherit `transform_func`
- `:nothing`: Inherit neither making the new `Transformation` an identity transformation

The `transformation` attribute also accepts inputs to the `transform!()` function.
This allows you to prepare a plot with an initial model transformation.
You can pass `scale`, `rotation` and/or `translation` as part of a NamedTuple, Dict or Attributes, or rotate and translate the xy plane to another plane with `(plane, shift)`.
For example:

```@figure backend=CairoMakie
f = Figure()
# transform 0..1 Rect to -1..1 Rect
lines(f[1, 1], Rect2f(0, 0, 1, 1),
    transformation = (scale = Vec3f(2), translation = Vec3f(-1)))

a = LScene(f[1, 2])
heatmap!(a, rand(4,4), transformation = (:xy, 0.5))
heatmap!(a, rand(4,4), transformation = (:xz, 0.5))
heatmap!(a, rand(4,4), transformation = (:yz, 0.5))
f
```

Finally you can also construct a `Transformation` object yourself and pass it through the `transformation` attribute.

## Constructors

As eluded to in the transformation function section there are some cases where constructing a `Transformation` yourself can be useful.
For example, you may want to apply `transform_func` before running a triangulation algorithm in a recipe so that the triangulation doesn't get distorted.
Or you may want to chain transformations of a series of plots to keep them relative to each other (see below).
There are a few constructors which are helpful to know for this.

If you want to fully detach a plot from its parents transformations, you can create it with `transformation = Transformation()`.
If you want to remove only the `transform_func` but not model transformations, you can use `transformation = Transformation(parent, transform_func = identity)`.
You can also pass different starting values for `translation`, `scale` and `rotation` to these functions.
This will not affect whether the parents model transformations are considered.

As an example, here are two arms on a cart raising a box with a rope.

```@figure backend=GLMakie
using Makie: Vec3d

f = Figure(size = (600, 400))
a = Axis(f[2, 2], aspect = DataAspect())
ylims!(0, 3); xlims!(-3, 3)

# Cart
cart = Transformation()
scatter!(a, [-0.32, -0.15, 0.15, 0.32], fill(0.09, 4), transformation = cart,
    marker = Circle, color = :transparent, strokewidth = 2, strokecolor = :black,
    markerspace = :data, markersize = 0.1
)
linesegments!(a, [-0.4, 0.4], [0.2, 0.2], transformation = cart,
    color = :black, linewidth = 5
)

# arms
arm1 = Transformation(cart, origin = Vec3d(0, 0.2, 0))
linesegments!(a, [0, 0], [0.2, 2], transformation = arm1,
    color = :black, linewidth = 5, linecap = :round
)
arm2 = Transformation(arm1, origin = Vec3d(0, 2, 0))
linesegments!(a, [0.0, 1.5], [2, 2], transformation = arm2,
    color = :black, linewidth = 5, linecap = :round
)

# rope - we want this to just extend downwards rather than inherit rotations
rope_length = Observable(1.0)
rope_points = map(arm2.model, rope_length) do model, len
    # position of end of arm2 after transformations apply
    rope_origin = (model * Point4(1.5, 2, 0, 1))[Vec(1,2)]
    rope_end = rope_origin - Vec2(0, len)
    return [rope_origin, rope_end]
end
crate_origin = map(ps -> ps[2] .+ Vec2(0, -0.12), rope_points)

linesegments!(a, rope_points,
    color = :black, linewidth = 3, linestyle = :dot, linecap = :round
)
scatter!(a, crate_origin,
    marker = Rect, color = :white, strokewidth = 2, strokecolor = :black,
    markerspace = :data, markersize = Vec2f(0.3, 0.2)
)

# Move cart
sl1 = Slider(f[3, 2], range = range(-4, 4, length = 101))
on(v -> translate!(cart, v, 0, 0), sl1.value)
# Pivot arm 1
sl2 = Slider(f[1, 2], range = range(-pi/3, pi/3, length = 101))
on(v -> Makie.rotate!(arm1, -v), sl2.value)
# Pivot arm 2
sl3 = Slider(f[2, 1], range = range(-pi/3, pi/3, length = 101), horizontal = false)
on(v -> Makie.rotate!(arm2, -v), sl3.value)
# Extend rope
sl4 = Slider(f[2, 3], range = range(2, 0.1, length = 101), startvalue = 1.0, horizontal = false)
on(v -> rope_length[] = v, sl4.value)

# Set up some configuration
set_close_to!(sl1, -1.0) # move cart to -1
set_close_to!(sl2, -0.5) # angle arm1 to the left
set_close_to!(sl3, 0.5) # counter-angle arm2 to be horizontal
set_close_to!(sl4, 0.5) # raise crate
