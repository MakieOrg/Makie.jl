# Pixel Perfect Rendering

Let's say you have some data in a matrix and want to plot it exactly as it is.
More explicitly you want each drawn pixel to sample from exactly one value of your matrix with no interpolation taking place.
This tutorial will explain how to do this.

## `heatmap` and `image`

To draw a matrix of values we can use `image` or `heatmap`.
With their default setting `image` is interpolated and uses a grayscale colormap while `heatmap` is pixelated and uses a colorful colormap (viridis).
They also differ in their placement of cells or "pixels".
In `image` you can set where the plot starts and ends, i.e. you set where the left edge of the left most pixel and the right edge of right most pixel is.
(Same for the bottom and top pixels.)
In `heatmap` you usually set where the cells centers are, though you can also set the edges by passing `size + 1` x and y values.
With the right settings both can be made to look the same:

```@figure
using CairoMakie

data = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6]

f = Figure()

a1, p = image(f[1, 1], data)
a2, p = heatmap(f[1, 2], data)

# 0..3, 0..2 is the default, we could omit it
a3, p = image(f[2, 1], 0..3, 0..2, data, colormap = :viridis, interpolate = false)
a4, p = heatmap(f[2, 2], 0:3, 0:2, data, colormap = :viridis, interpolate = false)
# Note that length(0:3), length(0:2) == size(data) .+ 1

limits!.([a1, a2, a3, a4], -1, 4, -1, 3)

f
```

## Full Screen Plot

Let us consider the case of creating a plain image from some data, without any of the usual Axis decorations.
In this case it is not useful to work with `Figure` and `Axis` as they both use up space through padding and layouting.
Instead, we use a `Scene` directly. An empty scene of a specific size can be created with

```@figure
using CairoMakie

scene = Scene(size = (200, 100), camera = campixel!)
```

Here we explicitly set `camera = campixel!` so that the scene uses pixel units.
More specifically, this sets the bottom left corner of the scene to (0, 0) and the top right corner to `size`.
Using those limits we can now draw an `image` (or `heatmap`) plot filling the scene exactly:

```@figure
using CairoMakie

data = [ifelse(x > 180, 0, x/100) * ifelse(y > 80, 0, y/50) for x in 1:200, y in 1:100]

scene = Scene(size = (200, 100), camera = campixel!)

# image will have the correct limits by default (0..200, 0..100)
image!(scene, data, colormap = :viridis, interpolate = false)

# alternatively with heatmap:
# heatmap!(scene, 0:200, 0:100, data)

scene
```

If we want to enlarge the image we can simply adjust the size of the scene and the limits of the plot.
For `heatmap` we need to be a bit careful though because `0:600` is going to give us 601 values rather than
the 201 we need.
To fix this we will need to explicitly include the size of each cell as the step of range.

```@figure
using CairoMakie

data = [ifelse(x > 180, 0, x/100) * ifelse(y > 80, 0, y/50) for x in 1:200, y in 1:100]
scene = Scene(size = (3 * 200, 2 * 100), camera = campixel!)
image!(scene, 0..600, 0..200, data, colormap = :viridis, interpolate = false)
# heatmap!(scene, 0:3:600, 0:2:200, data)

scene
```

Another option is to change `px_per_unit` when saving the scene.
Using `Makie.save(filename, scene, px_per_unit = 2)` each "pixel" in the scene is represented by 2 pixels in the saved image.
This does not affect the limits of the plot, i.e. in a (200, 100) scene you should use (200, 100) as the limits in your plots.
(If you check the images generated here you will see that they have twice the size given to the scene because the documentation renders with `pixel_per_unit = 2`)

### Notes

#### Camera

While the pixel camera is intuitive to use in this context it is not necessary.
If you create a scene without a camera, it will default to a clip space camera.
With that the size of coordinates of the scene always range from -1 to 1.
That may simplify plotting a bit, as you don't have to adjust the image limits when adjusting the scene limits:

```@figure
using CairoMakie

data = [ifelse(x > 180, 0, x/100) * ifelse(y > 80, 0, y/50) for x in 1:200, y in 1:100]
scene = Scene(size = (3 * 200, 2 * 100))
image!(scene, -1..1, -1..1, data, colormap = :viridis, interpolate = false)
scene
```

Similarly you can also use `camera = cam_relative!` to get 0..1 coordinates.

#### GLMakie

GLMakie uses FXAA to smooth out hard edges in the rendered image.
That means it will interpolate and/or blur pixels with significant brightness differences.
This is something we don't want here, so we should turn it off:

```@figure backend=GLMakie
using GLMakie

data = [ifelse(x > 180, 0, x/100) * ifelse(y > 80, 0, y/50) for x in 1:200, y in 1:100]
scene = Scene(size = (3 * 200, 2 * 100))
image!(scene, -1..1, -1..1, data, colormap = :viridis, interpolate = false, fxaa = false)
scene
```

WGLMakie uses MSAA instead, which samples each pixel at multiple sub-pixels.
With a pixel-perfect mapping this will sample the same color multiple times, resulting in the same final color.
So in WGLMakie we don't have this problem.

## Pixel Perfect Plotting in a Figure

### Using LScene

If you want to plot multiple pixel perfect matrices using a `Figure` for layouting is quite useful.
We can continue relying on the `Scene` mechanics we used above by using an `LScene`.
Here we will need to set the `width` and `height` instead of `size` to let layouting know how much space the LScene needs.
`resize_to_layout!()` is also quite useful to fit the Figure to the size of the scenes:

```@figure
using CairoMakie

# length(50:50) = 101
data = [x*y/1000 for x in -50:50, y in -50:50]

fig = Figure()

s1 = LScene(fig[1, 1], width = 101, height = 101, show_axis = false, scenekw = (camera = cam_relative!,))
image!(s1, 0..1, 0..1, data, colormap = :viridis, interpolate = false)

s2 = LScene(fig[1, 2], width = 101, height = 101, show_axis = false, scenekw = (camera = campixel!,))
heatmap!(s2, 0:101, 0:101, data)

resize_to_layout!(fig)
fig
```

To control the white space the figure generates, you can adjust `Figure(figure_padding = ...)` for the outer padding and `rowgap!(fig, ...)` and `colgap!(fig.layout, ...)` for the inner gaps.
See [Creating complex layouts](@ref).

### Using Axis

If you want to plot to an `Axis` you can effectively just replace `LScene` in the example above:

```@figure
using CairoMakie

# length(50:50) = 101
data = [x*y/1000 for x in -50:50, y in -50:50]

fig = Figure()

a1 = Axis(fig[1, 1], width = 101, height = 101)
image!(a1, data, colormap = :viridis, interpolate = false)

a2 = Axis(fig[1, 2], width = 101, height = 101)
heatmap!(a2, data)

resize_to_layout!(fig)
fig
```

For `image` and `heatmap` the axis will choose limits tightly aligned to the respective plot.
Therefore you don't need to match the x and y values of the plot to the dimensions of the data and Axis.
However you may still want to set them for `heatmap` so ticks are not aligned to cell centers.
You may also want to turn off the spines (`leftspinevisible = false` etc) as they overlap the edge of the image.
