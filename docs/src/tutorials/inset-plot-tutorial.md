# Creating an Inset Plot

An **inset plot** (or **inset axis**) is a small plot embedded within a larger plot. It is commonly used to zoom in on a particular region of interest, show detailed views of a subset of the data or provide additional contextual information alongside the main plot. Inset plots are a valuable tool for enhancing data visualization, making them widely used in research, business and presentations. In this tutorial we will discuss how to create an inset plot in Makie.

For example, in a plot showing stock prices over time, an inset can be used to display a magnified view of a specific time period to highlight price fluctuations more clearly.

Let's look at how to create this plot.

### 1. Load the Packages

Start by loading the CairoMakie backend package and Random package.

```@example inset
using CairoMakie
using Random
```

### 2. Prepare the Main Plot Data

Then we will generate the data required for the main plot (stock price data over a period of 500 days).

```@example inset
Random.seed!(123)
time = 1:500
stock_price = cumsum(randn(500) .+ 0.5)
```

### 3. Create the Main Plot

Use `Figure()` and `Axis()` to set up the main plot area and display the stock price data.

```@figure inset
fig = Figure(size = (800, 600))

ax_main = Axis(fig[1, 1],
    title="Stock Price Over Time",
    xlabel="Days",
    ylabel="Price")

line_main = lines!(ax_main, time, stock_price, color=:blue)
fig
```

### 4. Add an Inset Axis

Now let's add an inset axis inside the main plot. We will use the same `Axis()` function, but adjust its size and position to embed it within the main plot.

```@example inset
ax_inset = Axis(fig[1, 1],
    width=Relative(0.2),
    height=Relative(0.2),
    halign=0.1,
    valign=0.9,
    title="Zoomed View")
```

To adjust the axis size, use `width` and `height` attributes. To adjust the axis position, use `halign` and `valign` attributes.

### 5. Plot Data in the Inset

We need to define the data for the inset. For instance, select the data between 50 to 70 days range and corresponding data for the price movement.

```@figure inset
xlims!(ax_inset, 50, 70)
min_price, max_price = minimum(stock_price[50:70]), maximum(stock_price[50:70])
ylims!(ax_inset, min_price, max_price)
line_inset = lines!(ax_inset, time, stock_price, color=:red)
fig
```

### 6. Control Drawing Order of Axes

It is important to make sure that the inset plot is rendered above the main plot. This is done by setting the z-value in translate! function to a positive value.

```@example inset
translate!(ax_inset.blockscene, 0, 0, 150)
```

### 7. Add a Legend

Let's add a legend to clarify what each line represents.

```@example inset
Legend(fig[1, 2], [line_main, line_inset], ["Stock Price", "Zoomed Region"])
```

This adds a legend to the right of the figure, associating the blue line with the main plot and the red line with the inset plot.

### 8. Mark the Zoomed Section

Indicate the zoomed section of the main plot by drawing a border around the selected region.

```@figure inset
border_points = [
    Point(50, min_price),
    Point(70, min_price),
    Point(70, max_price),
    Point(50, max_price),
    Point(50, min_price)
]
lines!(ax_main, border_points, color=:black, linewidth=1)
save("output.png", fig) # hide
fig
```

## Complete Code Example

Hereâ€™s the complete code snippet.

```julia
# Load the packages
using CairoMakie
using Random

# Generate dummy stock price data
Random.seed!(123)
time = 1:500
stock_price = cumsum(randn(500) .+ 0.5)

# Create a figure
fig = Figure(size=(800, 600))

# Main plot
ax_main = Axis(fig[1, 1],
    title="Stock Price Over Time",
    xlabel="Days",
    ylabel="Price")

line_main = lines!(ax_main, time, stock_price, color=:blue)

# Inset axis
ax_inset = Axis(fig[1, 1],
    width=Relative(0.2),
    height=Relative(0.2),
    halign=0.1,
    valign=0.9,
    title="Zoomed View")

# Set xlims for a selected time data range
xlims!(ax_inset, 50, 70)

# Calculate and set ylims dynamically for the selected time data range
min_price, max_price = minimum(stock_price[50:70]), maximum(stock_price[50:70])
ylims!(ax_inset, min_price, max_price)

# Plot the data in the inset axis
line_inset = lines!(ax_inset, time, stock_price, color=:red)

# Z-Ordering for rendering order
translate!(ax_inset.blockscene, 0, 0, 150)

# Legend
Legend(fig[1, 2], [line_main, line_inset], ["Stock Price", "Zoomed Region"])

# Mark the zoomed section
border_points = [
    Point(50, min_price),  # Bottom left
    Point(70, min_price),  # Bottom right
    Point(70, max_price),  # Top right
    Point(50, max_price),  # Top left
    Point(50, min_price)   # Close the rectangle
]
lines!(ax_main, border_points, color=:black, linewidth=1)
fig
```

## Explanation of Key Elements and Related Information

### 1. Pixel Units vs. Relative Units for Inset Axis Size and Placement

Pixel Units: Specify exact size in pixels. Useful for precise sizes in fixed size layouts.
Example: `width = 200` sets the width to 200 pixels.

Relative Units: Define sizes as fractions of the parent container's size. Suitable for creating scalable layouts that adapt to different figure sizes.
Example: `width = Relative(0.2)` sets the width to 20% of the parent figure's width.

`halign` and `valign` position the inset plot relative to the figure, with values ranging from 0 (left or bottom) to 1 (right or top).

### 2. `translate!` Function and Z-Ordering

**z-order** (depth) determines the rendering order of elements, with higher z-values appearing in front of lower ones. This is critical for ensuring that the inset axis is visible above the main plot and its elements. By explicitly setting the z-value using the translate! function, you can layer elements as needed. If the translate! function is omitted or the z-value is too low, the inset plot may render behind the main plot, making it invisible or partially obscured.

In Makie, the z-order for various elements in an axis typically ranges from -100 to +20; 0 for user plots (by default). For an inset axis to reliably appear in front of the main axis and user plots, it must have a z-value of at least +100. If you are adding custom z-values for the main axis, ensure the inset axis has a z-value greater than the highest z-value in the main axis plus 100.

`main_axis_translate < inset_axis_translate - 100`

The maximum z-value allowed is 10,000.

```
translate!(obj, 0, 0, some_positive_z_value)
```

### 3. Marking the Section that the Inset Axis Shows

It is often helpful to visually indicate which part of the main plot corresponds to the inset axis. To achieve this we could draw a border around the selected region. We create a list of points (`border_points`) that outline the rectangle to mark the region of interest.
These points are calculated using:

* The x-axis range (e.g., 50 to 70) to mark the time period.
* The y-axis range (`min_price` and `max_price`) dynamically calculated from the data within this time range.

The border points are connected sequentially, and the final point closes the rectangle by connecting back to the first point. Parameters like color and linewidth can be adjusted for visibility and style.

```
border_points = [
    Point(50, min_price),  # Bottom left
    Point(70, min_price),  # Bottom right
    Point(70, max_price),  # Top right
    Point(50, max_price),  # Top left
    Point(50, min_price)   # Close the rectangle
]
lines!(ax_main, border_points, color=:black, linewidth=1)
```

Another approach to marking the selected region is to use the [zoom_lines](https://juliaaplavin.github.io/MakieExtraDocs.jl/notebooks/examples.html#3526c688-aea9-411b-a837-dc02ff81a7ee) function from the [MakieExtra.jl](https://juliapackages.com/p/makieextra) package. This function not only marks the region but also connects it to the inset axis with guiding lines, enhancing the visual connection between the main plot and the inset plot.
