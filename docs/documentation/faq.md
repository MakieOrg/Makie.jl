# Frequently Asked Questions

## Installation Issues

We assume you are running Julia on the default system image without PackageCompiler.

### No `Scene` displayed or GLMakie fails to build

If `Makie` builds, but when plotting no window or plot is displayed, your backend may not have built correctly.
By default, Makie will try to use GLMakie as a backend, but if it does not build correctly for whatever reason, then scenes will not be displayed.
Ensure that your graphics card supports OpenGL; if it does not (old models, or relatively old integrated graphics cards), then you may want to consider CairoMakie.

## Plotting issues

### Dimensions too large

In general, plotting functions tend to plot whatever's given to them as a single texture.  This can lead to GL errors, or OpenGL failing silently.  To circumvent this, one can 'tile' the plots (i.e., assemble them piece-by-piece) to decrease the individual texture size.

#### 2d plots (heatmaps, images, etc.)

```julia
heatmap(rand(Float32, 24900, 26620))
```
may either fail with an error
```julia
   Error showing value of type Scene:
ERROR: glTexImage 2D: width too large. Width: 24900
[...]
```
or fail silently:

Tiling the plot, as shown below, yields a correct image.

```julia
sc = Scene()
data = rand(Float32, 24900, 26620)
heatmap!(sc, 1:size(data, 1)÷2, 1:size(data, 2)÷2, data[1:end÷2, 1:end÷2])
heatmap!(sc, (size(data, 1)÷2 + 1):size(data, 1), 1:size(data, 2)÷2, data[(end÷2 + 1):end, 1:end÷2])
heatmap!(sc, 1:size(data, 1)÷2, (size(data, 2)÷2 + 1):size(data, 2), data[1:end÷2, (end÷2 + 1):end])
heatmap!(sc, (size(data, 1)÷2 + 1):size(data, 1), (size(data, 2)÷2 + 1):size(data, 2),
         data[(end÷2 + 1):end, (end÷2 + 1):end])
```

#### 3d plots (volumes)

The approach here is similar to that for the 2d plots, except that here there is a helpful function that gives the maximum texture size.
You can check the maximum texture size with:
```julia
using Makie, GLMakie, ModernGL
# simple plot to open a window (needs to be open for opengl)
display(scatter(rand(10)))
glGetIntegerv(GL_MAX_3D_TEXTURE_SIZE)
```
and then just split the volume:
```julia
vol = rand(506, 720, 1440)
ranges = (1:256, 1:256, 1:256)
scene = volume(ranges..., vol[ranges...])
for i in 1:3
    global ranges
    ranges = ntuple(3) do j
        s = j == i ? last(ranges[j]) : 1
        e = j == i ? size(vol, j) : last(ranges[j])
        s:e
    end
    volume!(ranges..., vol[ranges...])
end
scene
```

## General issues

### My font doesn't work!

If `Makie` can't find your font, you can do two things:

1) Check that the name matches and that the font is in one of the directories in:

    - `using FreeTypeAbstraction; FreeTypeAbstraction.valid_fontpaths`

2) You can add a custom font path via the environment variable:

    - `ENV["FREETYPE_ABSTRACTION_FONT_PATH"] = "/path/to/your/fonts"`

3) Specify the path to the font; instead of `font = "Noto"`, you could write `joindir(homedir(), "Noto.ttf")` or something.


## Layout Issues

### Elements are squashed into the lower left corner

Layoutable elements require a bounding box that they align themselves to. If you
place such an element in a layout, the bounding box is controlled by that layout.
If you forget to put an element in a layout, it will have its default bounding box
of `BBox(0, 100, 0, 100)` which ends up being in the lower left corner. You can
also choose to specify a bounding box manually if you need more control.

\begin{examplefigure}{}
```julia
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!() # hide

f = Figure()

ax1 = Axis(f, title = "Squashed")
ax2 = Axis(f[1, 1], title = "Placed in Layout")
ax3 = Axis(f, bbox = BBox(200, 600, 100, 500),
  title = "Placed at BBox(200, 600, 100, 500)")

f
```
\end{examplefigure}


### Columns or rows are shrunk to the size of Text or another element

Columns or rows that have size `Auto(true)` try to determine the width or height of all
single-spanned elements that are placed in them, and if any elements report their
size the row or column will shrink to the maximum reported size. This is so smaller
elements with a known size take as little space as needed. But if there is other
content in the row that should take more space, you can give the offending element
the attribute `tellheight = false` or `tellwidth = false`. This way, its own size
can be determined automatically, but
it doesn't report it to the row or column of the layout. Alternatively, you can set the size
of that row or column to `Auto(false)` (or any other value than `Auto(true)`).

\begin{examplefigure}{}
```julia
using CairoMakie

f = Figure()

Axis(f[1, 1], title = "Shrunk")
Axis(f[2, 1], title = "Expanded")
Label(f[1, 2], "tellheight = true", tellheight = true)
Label(f[2, 2], "tellheight = false", tellheight = false)

f
```
\end{examplefigure}
