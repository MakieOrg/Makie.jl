# Figures

The `Figure` object contains a top-level `Scene` and a `GridLayout`, as well as a list of layoutables that have been placed into it, like `Axis`, `Colorbar`, `Slider`, `Legend`, etc.

!!! note
    Wherever you see the old `scene, layout = layoutscene()` workflow from MakieLayout, you can imagine that
    the `Figure` takes over the role of both `scene` and `layout`, plus additional conveniences like keeping
    track of layoutables.

## Creating a `Figure`

You can create a figure explicitly with the `Figure()` function, and set attributes of the underlying scene.
The most important one of which is the `resolution`.

```julia
f = Figure()
f = Figure(resolution = (600, 400))
```

A figure is also created implicitly when you use simple, non-mutating plotting commands like `plot()`, `scatter()`, `lines()`, etc.
Because these commands also create an axis for the plot to live in and the plot itself, they return a compound object `FigureAxisPlot`, which just stores these three parts.
To access the figure you can either destructure that object into its three parts or access the figure field directly.

```julia
figureaxisplot = scatter(rand(100, 2))
figure = figureaxisplot.figure

# destructuring syntax
figure, axis, plot = scatter(rand(100, 2))

# you can also ignore components
figure, = scatter(rand(100, 2))
```

You can pass arguments to the created figure in a dict-like object to the special `figure` keyword:

```julia
scatter(rand(100, 2), figure = (resolution = (600, 400),))
```

## Placing layoutables into a `Figure`

All layoutables take their parent figure as the first argument, then you can place them in the figure layout via indexing syntax.

```julia
f = Figure()
ax = f[1, 1] = Axis(f)
sl = f[2, 1] = Slider(f)
```

## `GridPosition`s and `GridSubposition`s

The indexing syntax of `Figure` is implemented to work seamlessly with layouting.
If you index into the figure, a `GridPosition` object that stores this indexing operation is created.
This object can be used to plot a new axis into a certain layout position in the figure, for example like this:

\begin{examplefigure}{}
```julia
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!() # hide

f = Figure()
pos = f[1, 1]
scatter(pos, rand(100, 2))

pos2 = f[1, 2]
lines(pos2, cumsum(randn(100)))

# you don't have to store the position in a variable first, of course
heatmap(f[1, 3], randn(10, 10))

f
```
\end{examplefigure}


You can also index further into a `GridPosition`, which creates a `GridSubposition`.
With `GridSubposition`s you can describe positions in arbitrarily nested grid layouts.
Often, a desired plot layout can only be achieved with nesting, and repeatedly indexing makes this easy.

\begin{examplefigure}{}
```julia
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!() # hide

f = Figure()

f[1, 1] = Axis(f, title = "I'm not nested")
f[1, 2][1, 1] = Axis(f, title = "I'm nested")

# plotting into nested positions also works
heatmap(f[1, 2][2, 1], randn(20, 20))

f
```
\end{examplefigure}


All nested GridLayouts that don't exist yet, but are needed for a nested plotting call, are created in the background automatically.

!!! note
    The `GridLayout`s that are implicitly created when using `GridSubpositions` are not directly available in the return
    value for further manipulation. You can instead retrieve them after the fact with the `content` function, for example,
    as explained in the following section.


## Figure padding

You can change the amount of whitespace around the figure content with the keyword `figure_padding`.
This takes either a number for all four sides, or a tuple of four numbers for left, right, bottom, top.
You can also theme this setting with `set_theme!(figure_padding = 30)`, for example.

\begin{examplefigure}{}
```julia
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!() # hide

f = Figure(figure_padding = 1, backgroundcolor = :gray80)

Axis(f[1, 1])
scatter!(1:10)

f
```
\end{examplefigure}

## Retrieving Objects From A Figure

Sometimes users are surprised that indexing into a figure does not retrieve the object placed at that position.
This is because the `GridPosition` is needed for plotting, and returning content objects directly would take away that possibility.
Furthermore, a `GridLayout` can hold multiple objects at the same position, or have partially overlapping content,
so it's not well-defined what should be returned given a certain index.

To retrieve objects from a Figure you can instead use indexing plus the `contents` or `content` functions.
The `contents` function returns a Vector of all objects found at the given `GridPosition`.
You can use the `exact = true` keyword argument so that the position has to match exactly, otherwise objects
contained in that position are also returned.

```julia
f = Figure()
box = f[1:3, 1:2] = Box(f)
ax = f[1, 1] = Axis(f)

contents(f[1, 1]) == [ax]
contents(f[1:3, 1:2]) == [box, ax]
contents(f[1:3, 1:2], exact = true) == [box]
```

If you use `contents` on a `GridSubposition`, the `exact` keyword only refers to the lowest-level
grid layout, all upper levels have to match exactly.

```julia
f = Figure()
ax = f[1, 1][2, 3] = Axis(f)

contents(f[1, 1][2, 3]) == [ax]
contents(f[1:2, 1:2][2, 3]) == [] # the upper level has to match exactly
```

Often, you will expect only one object at a certain position and you want to work directly with it, without
retrieving it from the Vector returned by `contents`.
In that case, use the `content` function instead.
It works equivalently to `only(contents(pos, exact = true))`, so it errors if it can't return exactly one object
from an exact given position.

```julia
f = Figure()
ax = f[1, 1] = Axis(f)

contents(f[1, 1]) == [ax]
content(f[1, 1]) == ax
```
