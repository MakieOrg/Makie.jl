# Colors

## Named colors
Named colors in Makie.jl (e.g., `:blue`) are parsed using [Colors.jl](https://juliagraphics.github.io/Colors.jl/stable/constructionandconversion/#Color-Parsing) and thus have a large array of possibilities under CSS specifications. You can find a plotted table of all possible names in this page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#color_keywords
