# Scenes

## What is a `Scene`?

`Scene`s are fundamental building blocks of Makie figures.
A Scene is like a container for `Plot`s and other `Scene`s.
`Scenes` have `Plot`s (including an `Axis` if `show_axis = true`) and `Subscenes` associated with them.
Every Scene also has a transformation, made up of _scale_, _translation_, and _rotation_.

!!! note
    Before the introduction of the `Figure` workflow, `Scene`s used to be the main container object which was returned from all plotting functions.
    Now, scenes are mostly an implementation detail for many users, unless they want to build custom solutions that go beyond what the default system offers.

A Scene's plots can be accessed via `scene.plots`.

A Scene's subscenes (also called children) can be accessed through `scene.children`.  This will return an Array of the `Scene`'s child scenes.  A child scene can be created by `childscene = Scene(parentscene)`.

Any `Scene` with an axis also has a `camera` associated with it; this can be accessed through `scene.camera`, and its controls through `scene.camera.cameracontrols`.  More documentation about these is in the \myreflink{Cameras} section.

`Scene`'s also have configurable size/resolution. You can set the size in pixels by doing `Scene(resolution = (500, 500))`.

Any keyword argument given to the `Scene` will be propagated to its plots; therefore, you can set the palette or the colormap in the Scene itself.

## Subscenes

A subscene is no different than a normal Scene, except that it is linked to a "parent" Scene.  It inherits the transformations of the parent Scene, but can then be transformed independently of it.

## Modifying A Scene

Makie offers mutation functions to scale, translate and rotate your Scenes on the fly.

{{doc translate!}}
{{doc rotate!}}
{{doc scale!}}

## Updating the Scene

When the Scene is changed, you may need to update several aspects of it.  
Makie provides three main updating functions:

{{doc update!}}
{{doc update_limits!}}
{{doc update_cam!}}

In general, `update!` is to be used to keep data in sync, and `update_cam!` and `update_limits!` update the camera and limits respectively (to show all the data).

## Events

Scenes have several pre-created event "hooks" (through Observables) that you can handle.  These can be accessed through `scene.events`, which returns an [`Events`](@ref) struct.
