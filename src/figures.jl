Figures are supposed to fill the gap that Scenes in combination with Blocks leave.
A scene is supposed to be a generic canvas on which plot objects can be placed and drawn.
Blocks always require one specific type of scene, with a PixelCamera, in order to draw
their visual components there.
Figures also have layouts, which scenes do not have.
This is because every figure needs a layout, while not every scene does.
Figures keep track of the Blocks that are created inside them, which scenes don't.

The idea is there are three types of plotting commands.
They can return either:
    - a FigureAxisPlot (figure, axis and plot)
    - an AxisPlot (axis and plot)
    - or an AbstractPlot (only plot)

This is needed so that users can without much boilerplate create the necessary structures and access them accordingly.

A normal plotting command creates a FigureAxisPlot, which can be splatted into figure, axis and plot. It displays like a figure, so that simple plots show up immediately.

A non-mutating plotting command that references a GridPosition or a GridSubposition creates an axis at that position and returns an AxisPlot, which can be splatted into axis and plot.

All mutating plotting commands return AbstractPlots.
They can either reference a GridPosition or a GridSubposition, in which case it is looked up
if an axis is placed at that position (if not it errors) or it can reference an axis directly to plot into.
