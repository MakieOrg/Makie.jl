Marks a button, button collection or logical expression of buttons as the

For example `Exclusively((Keyboard.left_control, Keyboard.c))` would require
left control and c to be pressed without any other buttons.

Boolean expressions are lowered to multiple `Exclusive` sets in an `Or`. It is
worth noting that `Not` branches are ignored here, i.e. it assumed that every
button under a `Not` must not be pressed and that this follows automatically
from the subset of buttons that must be pressed.

This function checks if a button or combination of buttons is pressed.

If given a true or false, `ispressed` will return true or false respectively.
This provides a way to turn an interaction "always on" or "always off" from the
outside.

Passing a button or collection of buttons such as `Keyboard.enter` or
`Mouse.left` will return true if all of the given buttons are pressed.

Parent can be any object that has `get_scene` method implemented, which includes
e.g. Figure, Axis, Axis3, Lscene, FigureAxisPlot, and AxisPlot.

For more complicated combinations of buttons they can be combined into boolean
expression with `&`, `|` and `!`. For example, you can have
`ispressed(parent, !Keyboard.left_control & Keyboard.c))` and
`ispressed(parent, Keyboard.left_control & Keyboard.c)` to avoid triggering both
cases at the same time.

Furthermore you can also make any button, button collection or boolean
expression exclusive by wrapping it in `Exclusively(...)`. With that `ispressed`
will only return true if the currently pressed buttons match the request exactly.

For cases where you want to react to a release event you can optionally add
a key or mousebutton `waspressed` which is then assumed to be pressed regardless
of it's current state. For example, when reacting to a mousebutton event, you can
pass `event.button` so that a key combination including that button still evaluates
as true.
