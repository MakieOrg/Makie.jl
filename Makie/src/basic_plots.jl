### Generic attributes

- `visible::Bool = true` sets whether the plot will be rendered or not.
- `overdraw::Bool = false` sets whether the plot will draw over other plots. This specifically means ignoring depth checks in GL backends.
- `transparency::Bool = false` adjusts how the plot deals with transparency. In GLMakie `transparency = true` results in using Order Independent Transparency.
- `fxaa::Bool = true` adjusts whether the plot is rendered with fxaa (anti-aliasing).
- `inspectable::Bool = true` sets whether this plot should be seen by `DataInspector`.
- `depth_shift::Float32 = 0f0` adjusts the depth value of a plot after all other transformations, i.e. in clip space, where `0 <= depth <= 1`. This only applies to GLMakie and WGLMakie and can be used to adjust render order (like a tunable overdraw).
- `model::Makie.Mat4f` sets a model matrix for the plot. This replaces adjustments made with `translate!`, `rotate!` and `scale!`.
- `space::Symbol = :data` sets the transformation space for box encompassing the volume plot. See `Makie.spaces()` for possible inputs.
- `clip_planes::Vector{Plane3f} = Plane3f[]`: allows you to specify up to 8 planes behind which plot objects get clipped (i.e. become invisible). By default clip planes are inherited from the parent plot or scene.
