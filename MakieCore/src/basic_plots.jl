- `depth_shift::Float32 = 0f0` adjusts the depth value of a plot after all other transformations, i.e. in clip space, where `0 <= depth <= 1`. This only applies to GLMakie and WGLMakie and can be used to adjust render order (like a tunable overdraw). 
- `model::Makie.Mat4f` sets a model matrix for the plot. This replaces adjustments made with `translate!`, `rotate!` and `scale!`.
- `color` sets the color of the plot. It can be given as a named color `Symbol` or a `Colors.Colorant`. Transparency can be included either directly as an alpha value in the `Colorant` or as an additional float in a tuple `(color, alpha)`. The color can also be set for each scattered mesh by passing a `Vector` of colors or be used to index the `colormap` by passing a `Real` number or `Vector{<: Real}`. 
- `colormap::Union{Symbol, Vector{<:Colorant}} = :viridis` sets the colormap that is sampled for numeric `color`s.
- `colorrange::Tuple{<:Real, <:Real}` sets the values representing the start and end points of `colormap`.
- `nan_color::Union{Symbol, <:Colorant} = RGBAf(0,0,0,0)` sets a replacement color for `color = NaN`.
- `space::Symbol = :data` sets the transformation space for the positions of meshes. See `Makie.spaces()` for possible inputs.

### Generic 3D

- `shading = true` enables lighting.
- `diffuse::Vec3f = Vec3f(0.4)` sets how strongly the red, green and blue channel react to diffuse (scattered) light. 
- `specular::Vec3f = Vec3f(0.2)` sets how strongly the object reflects light in the red, green and blue channels.
- `shininess::Real = 32.0` sets how sharp the reflection is.
- `ssao::Bool = false` adjusts whether the plot is rendered with ssao (screen space ambient occlusion). Note that this only makes sense in 3D plots and is only applicable with `fxaa = true`.

    text(positions; text, kwargs...)

    text(x, y, z; text, kwargs...)

Plots one or multiple texts passed via the `text` keyword.
`Text` uses the `PointBased` conversion trait.

## Attributes

### Specific to `Text`

- `text` specifies one piece of text or a vector of texts to show, where the number has to match the number of positions given. Makie supports `String` which is used for all normal text and `LaTeXString` which layouts mathematical expressions using `MathTeXEngine.jl`.
- `align::Tuple{Union{Symbol, Real}, Union{Symbol, Real}} = (:left, :bottom)` sets the alignment of the string w.r.t. `position`. Uses `:left, :center, :right, :top, :bottom, :baseline` or fractions.
- `font::Union{String, Vector{String}} = "TeX Gyre Heros Makie"` sets the font for the string or each character.
- `justification::Union{Real, Symbol} = automatic` sets the alignment of text w.r.t its bounding box. Can be `:left, :center, :right` or a fraction. Will default to the horizontal alignment in `align`.
- `rotation::Union{Real, Quaternion}` rotates text around the given position.
- `textsize::Union{Real, Vec2f}` sets the size of each character.
- `markerspace::Symbol = :pixel` sets the space in which `textsize` acts. See `Makie.spaces()` for possible inputs.
- `strokewidth::Real = 0` sets the width of the outline around a marker.
- `strokecolor::Union{Symbol, <:Colorant} = :black` sets the color of the outline around a marker.
- `glowwidth::Real = 0` sets the size of a glow effect around the marker.
- `glowcolor::Union{Symbol, <:Colorant} = (:black, 0)` sets the color of the glow effect.
- `word_wrap_with::Real = -1` specifies a linewidth limit for text. If a word overflows this limit, a newline is inserted before it. Negative numbers disable word wrapping.

### Generic attributes

- `visible::Bool = true` sets whether the plot will be rendered or not.
- `overdraw::Bool = false` sets whether the plot will draw over other plots. This specifically means ignoring depth checks in GL backends.
- `transparency::Bool = false` adjusts how the plot deals with transparency. In GLMakie `transparency = true` results in using Order Independent Transparency.
- `fxaa::Bool = false` adjusts whether the plot is rendered with fxaa (anti-aliasing). Note that text plots already include a different form of anti-aliasing.
- `inspectable::Bool = true` sets whether this plot should be seen by `DataInspector`.
- `depth_shift::Float32 = 0f0` adjusts the depth value of a plot after all other transformations, i.e. in clip space, where `0 <= depth <= 1`. This only applies to GLMakie and WGLMakie and can be used to adjust render order (like a tunable overdraw).
- `model::Makie.Mat4f` sets a model matrix for the plot. This replaces adjustments made with `translate!`, `rotate!` and `scale!`.
- `color` sets the color of the plot. It can be given as a named color `Symbol` or a `Colors.Colorant`. Transparency can be included either directly as an alpha value in the `Colorant` or as an additional float in a tuple `(color, alpha)`. The color can also be set for each character by passing a `Vector` of colors.
- `space::Symbol = :data` sets the transformation space for text positions. See `Makie.spaces()` for possible inputs.
