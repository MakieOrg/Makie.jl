# Info
* Please don't force push to PRs, it removes the history, creates bad notifications, and we will squash and merge in the end.
* Feel free to ping for a review after a few days (@simondanisch, @ffreyer). We can't guarantee a review in a certain time frame, but we can guarantee to forget about PRs after a while.
* The easier a PR is to review, the easier we can merge it:
    * The more tests you add, the easier it is to see that your change works
    * The clearer the problem being solved the easier.
* Allowing write access on the PR makes things more convenient, since we can make edits to the PR directly and update it if it gets out of sync with `master`.
